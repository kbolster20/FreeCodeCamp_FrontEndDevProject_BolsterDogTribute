                            perfect mix of energetic but not over-bearing and did not seem to try to dominate her brothers and sisters. After looking at many dogs in our search for the perfect pup Peanut checked all the boxes and we were in love before

                            NY. He was the the most chilled out pup we'd ever seen. He didn't seem to have a dominant bone in his body. When he met Peanut we saw some real spunk. This guy loves to play with other dogs and chill with his human counterparts.

                    <p>She's shy and skittish and isn't a fan of new situations. She will often shy away from men she doesn't know but once she knows you, you've got a friend for life. Her favorite things are taking walks at the pond where she'll explore
                        and run for miles and miles. </p>

                    <p>She loves Maverick and other dogs she knows well but is sometimes wary of dogs she doesn't know. She wants to be with her people at all times, but is fine being home by herself while we're off in the human world. She snorts while awake
                        and snores like a sailor while asleep. I've never met a dog that loves her people so much and we are blessed as a family to have her!</p>

                    <p>For Christmas we purchased Wisdom Panel DNA tests for our rescue pups. I was anxious to see what breeds they actually were. Maverick was labeled as a Lab mix when we adopted her. Here's what the Wisdom Panel results showed:

                    <p>I was surprised to not see lab on there. His ears seem very "labby" to me. Regardless, he's a great pup no matter what the breed makeup!</p>

                    <p>Maverick's temperment is amazing. I have never seen such a chill dog in my life. He loves to play and is by no means a dud, however, not much phases him. He is definitely a zen, go with the flow type pup. His feathers don't get ruffled
                        easily and he's up for anything. He is the perfect balance for the intensity of Peanut's personality. The only thing that tends to get under Mav's skin are birds. He does not love birds and will bark at them and chase them in the
                        yard.
                    </p>
                    <p>I would have to say that Maverick's favorite thing ever is to play with other dogs. He LOVES to play with any and all other dogs. He seems to get along with everyone and would keep playing for hours if he could. He's also taken up
                        swimming which I find very exciting - he'll swim out in the pond to fetch a toy. This is a new development so we'll have to see if it sticks.</p>
                    <p>Some of Maverick's quirks is that he is a total nibbler. He likes to nibble things with his front teeth. Peanut loves it and I imagine it feels like a massage to her. He has a blanky (we could have named him Linus) that he drags around
                        the house with and periodically nibbles little circles out of. We call him the dog moth. He also has the worst smelling farts I've ever come in contact with. Perhaps the moth behavior and his stinky butt are related!</p>
                    <p>All in all we couldn't be luckier to have such a sweet, obedient, up for anything pup. He makes us laugh and smile everyday and I couldn't be happier we have him!</p>
